# Test requirements

## Commands & reproducibility
1. Every command (in docs and chat) must be written in full, with all arguments explicit.
2. All CLI arguments are required — no implicit defaults that silently change behaviour.
3. Commands must fail fast, stating exactly which argument to set, when one is missing.
4. The goal is that a random person on a random network/device can run the tests from the written commands alone.
5. The test commands are run manually by the human, not by an AI that can resolve intermediate issues.
6. An argument must be required only if silently defaulting it could make the run test the wrong thing or hit the wrong target unnoticed; values that are purely derived from a required argument (e.g. EXTRA from FLAKE) or are mere timeouts may keep defaults.

## Test matrix & scope
7. Provide integration tests covering the whole UI / Flutter app.
8. Every test has an accompanying recording, and the recording must correspond to what the test actually tests.
9. Determine which tests can run on a single deployment and which interfere (require a fresh deployment).
10. A test requires a fresh deployment when it changes settings/state that another test relies on relative to the clean/initial deployment.
11. Group tests by whether they can share one deployment vs. must be isolated.
12. Each test declares the repos it depends on; this scopes both its state identity and its clean-state gate.
13. Structure: test group (A) with a command to run the whole group; tests within a group (A.1) each with a command to run just that test.
14. Keep `N/A` for entries/combinations that are not available.

## Networks
15. Supported networks: Tor, Tor+https, Chutney, Chutney+https, Https, Yggdrasil, Hyphanet.
16. Per test, record which network SelfPrivacy uses.
17. Per network, record in which network setup the test was run.
18. Per network setup, record whether it was run Locally or on CI.

## Network setups
19. `vm-local`: VirtualBox VM on the host (build-and-run.sh), no external wiring.
20. `lan-setup-0a`: direct cable, router out of path, netboot install; cable later replugged into the router for its IP; no wifi config.
21. `lan-setup-0b`: as 0a, plus a wifi config for the same router R.
22. `lan-setup-0c`: as 0a, plus a wifi config for a different router B.
23. `lan-setup-0d`: direct-cable install; cable later removed; target runs wifi-only (wifi reaching the internet).
24. `lan-setup-1`: laptop on router R's wifi, target wired to R (requires R configured for netboot).
25. `lan-setup-2`: laptop and target both on router R's wifi (requires R configured for netboot).
26. `usb-0a`: installer USB → target internal disk (manual boot); target wired to router R for internet.
27. `usb-0b`: as usb-0a, plus a wifi config for the same router R.
28. `usb-0c`: as usb-0a, plus a wifi config for a different router B.
29. Use one diagram per setup family (direct-cable family, usb family) to avoid duplication, without altering any option.

## Stamping & deployment identity
30. Tests must only ever run against the most recent / desired code state.
31. The system must be able to determine whether a deployed box corresponds to a given code state.
32. The target is stamped at deployment with the identity of what was deployed.
33. The stamp is based (hash-wise) on the list of repos, branches and commits used for the deployment.
34. Dirty deployments are not permitted; if dirty, that must be indicated with a hashsum of the dirtiness.
35. A test that uses the target retrieves the stamp from the device and links it to the code states it knows (locally or in committed history).
36. A test that uses the target verifies the stamp first and refuses to run if it is not the desired state.
37. This applies to every install method, including USB.
38. A manual/USB test is one uninterrupted chain: prompt to insert the USB and confirm "did you install it on the target?", then continue into the test.
39. When the box cannot be verified, distinguish "reachable but not stamped" from "unreachable".
40. Tests error if the flake.lock does not correspond to the selfprivacy-api checkout (rev differs or checkout dirty).
41. The dashboard shows an additional warning when the api checkout ≠ the deployed flake.lock pin (similar to the dirty warning).

## Dirty / clean state & integrity
42. At the start of a test, verify the code state is not dirty; if code changed, ask to commit the current state before running, so all tests run on the same code.
43. The clean-state gate checks all repos a test uses, not just one.
44. A submodule's working checkout must match the superproject's recorded pointer (no drift); otherwise refuse.
45. Test-result data must not be a factor in the clean-state check (so multiple tests can run back-to-back without each run dirtying/altering the code state).

## Results storage
46. Commit all test-result data except videos.
47. Videos are local-only artifacts; never committed.
48. Store results in a separate repo (testresults) so recording results never dirties or changes the code commit.
49. Results are keyed by the code state, so recording a result does not change that state.
50. Easily see which commands were already run and what their output was, per commit/state.
51. Be able to correct what is recorded for which test.

## Dashboard / visualization
52. An additional dashboard, based on the current one.
53. Scroll through branches and commits (states) and reload the accompanying test history on selection.
54. Hierarchy per test: test group → test → network → network setup → Local/CI.
55. The selectable state at the branch/commit level is the whole repo combination (all repos/commits used), not a single repo.
56. Per test run configuration, fold down the list of past runs for that configuration on the same state.
57. Collapsing a test shows only the latest result for each configuration.
58. Show pass / fail / N/A.
59. Click a status dot to see that run's log/output.
60. For local runs, view the recordings (both screenshots and videos).
61. Commands are not always shown; they appear on hover, with a clickable copy item in the top-right corner.
62. Hover/click the dirty-state warning to see which repos and branches are dirty.
63. Show all repos and branches a test uses (even when clean) and the commits per branch per repo, so the exact config under test is visible.
64. Display the deployed flake.lock pins for the selected state.

## CI vs local
65. Record, per run, whether it was executed Locally or on CI.
66. In CI, the recorded repo/branch/commit is whatever CI checked out (the committed refs from the git server).

## Dashboard / visualization (status model)
67. The matrix is catalog-driven: it shows every test as the overview even with no results — each applicable network × setup × {Local,CI} cell defaults to ☐ todo.
68. Cell statuses are todo / pass / fail / N/A (N/A for an unsupported network or a non-applicable setup).
69. Hovering a ☐ todo cell shows the exact command to run that test (with a copy button).

## Setup availability (preflight)
70. At the start of a test, verify the specified setup is available, as far as it can be checked.
71. USB setups: a USB device is present (and empty, if emptiness is required).
72. Wifi setups: a wifi spec (SSID, plus credentials as needed) must be specified.
73. Verify the specified wifi is in range / yields internet only when that is possible without disturbing the current wifi connection (e.g. a scan confirms the SSID is in range; the PASSWORD can only be verified by associating, so it is tested only when a wifi radio is free — not the one in use — otherwise it is flagged as not-verified (orange warning); internet-through-it is not checked if that would require connecting).

## Dashboard / visualization (explanatory hovers)
74. Hovering a test group (level) or a test shows a brief explanation of what it tests (sourced from the catalog `levels`/`desc`).
75. Hovering a ⚪ N/A cell shows a brief reason it is not available: a roadmap transport that is not implemented yet (catalog `future_networks`), or not applicable because that test does not exercise that transport.
76. The matrix shows a sub-header row under the setup columns indicating the Local/CI split (each cell holds two dots: local, then CI).

## Integrity — a result must reflect the committed code (no silent green)
77. A pass must mean the committed code of the recorded state actually ran; any divergence between what runs and the intended code must be detected — refuse or fail, never a silent pass.
78. Pins recorded for a run, and the pin gate, are read from the flake.lock that actually governs that run's build: a self-contained test uses its OWN flake.lock, not the backend's.
79. The pin gate checks every input the governing lock pins (e.g. selfprivacy-api AND manager), not only the api.
80. A nix build that reused an existing output (nothing built; no VM ran) is flagged (from_cache), not shown as a fresh run.
81. An output fetched from a binary cache (substituted — built elsewhere, not run here) is flagged.
82. A self-contained test's nixpkgs matches the deployed backend's nixpkgs (test ↔ production parity).
83. L3 drives the app with a pinned toolchain (the app flake's flutter) and resolves deps with the lockfile enforced; a toolchain/dep mismatch fails loud instead of silently regenerating the lockfile.
84. The box-identity check measures the box's actual running system (/run/current-system vs a baseline recorded at install), not only the install-time stamp.
85. A run forced past a gate (--allow-dirty) is recorded and shown as forced — never indistinguishable from a clean pass.
86. Manually-reported (click-through/video) results are marked manual/self-attested, distinct from automated runs.
87. A transient/flaky retry attempt is retained (marked flaky), not deleted, so intermittent failures are not hidden.
88. A checkout behind its tracked upstream blocks the run (after refreshing the remote ref); bypass only with --allow-dirty (then recorded as forced).
89. A live target address (e.g. the backend .onion) is read live from the backend, not from stale local state.

## Integrity — to implement (Track 2)
90. L3 real-data assertions run against a known-clean backend baseline: mutable state (userdata, enabled services, users, DB) is snapshot/restored (or reset) per flow so a result reflects the code, not leftover state; what the reset cannot cover is logged.
91. The clean-state check also catches build-affecting inputs invisible to `git status`: gitignored files (e.g. users.nix, .env) and a non-hermetic nix config (sandbox disabled / --impure).
92. The recorded state identity is the exact build closure (derivation path/hash), not only the three input pins.

## Dashboard / visualization (run history & flakiness)
93. One circle never represents multiple runs; each run is its own circle.
94. A config's runs are shown chronologically: collapsed shows only the most recent; expanded shows the full sequence, newest on top → oldest on the bottom.
95. Flakiness is represented by the green/red sequence of per-run circles, not by an aggregate marker or count.
96. Each run circle links to that run's log/media.
97. A run carrying trust qualifiers (forced/manual/cached/substituted/behind) is marked per-run (e.g. a ring), distinct from a clean run.

## Integrity — L3 backend targeting (Track 2, item 1a)
98. L3 desktop flows run against the backend named by the test args (`--on <setup>`): `vm-local` → the local VirtualBox VM; `lan-setup-0a..0d` / `lan-setup-1` / `lan-setup-2` / `usb-0a..0c` → a deployed physical box reached over the LAN. The backend is never hardcoded to the VM.
99. Running an L3 flow against a box requires `--ip`, `--key`, and `--token`; the box's API token is per-box and secret, so it is never defaulted (reproducibility reqs 1–6). Missing args fail fast, naming what to set.
100. For a box the dialed address is read LIVE from the box (req 89), never from stale local state: the onion from `/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname`, the https host as `api.<domain>` where `domain` comes from the box's `/etc/nixos/userdata.json`.
101. `chutney` is a laptop-local private Tor network, valid for `vm-local` only; a box is reached over `tor` (real onion) or `https` (public domain, system-trust LE cert — no tunnel/mkcert CA). An unsupported network×setup combination is rejected fast.
102. An L3 run records the real setup as its `method` so the result lands in the correct matrix column; for a box, the deployment provenance the box-identity gate computed (stamp, measured running-system, box repos+pins) is recorded on the run.
103. The clean-state, pin, and behind-upstream gates apply to every gated run — a test (identified by its `level`) as well as an install — not only installs. The L3 inner recorder does not re-gate a run whose outer run_entry already gated it.

## Integrity — clean per-L3 backend-state baseline (Track 2, item 1b, req 90)
104. Around each L3 flow the backend's mutable SP state (`/etc/nixos/userdata.json`: enabled services = `modules.*.enable`, users, dns/server/provider config) is snapshotted before the flow and restored after, so a real-data assertion reflects the code, not leftover state. Target-aware (the VM or the box the run used).
105. The pre-flow state is compared to a captured known-clean golden baseline (keyed by the deployed backend's state identity + setup); drift is recorded (`l3_baseline_match`/`l3_baseline_drift`) and surfaced, not silently absorbed into the result.
106. The golden baseline is blessed right after a fresh install — explicitly via `dash l3-baseline capture --on <setup> …`, or auto-captured from the first flow's pre-state with a loud note that it assumes a fresh install. It stores only a state hash + the module/user summary — never secrets.
107. Restore is hybrid: service-enable changes are reverted via the `enable/disableService` mutation (which triggers the real rebuild), and any remaining `userdata.json` fields are file-restored; the restore reads the backend's `.onion` live.
108. What snapshot/restore cannot cover is listed on the run (`l3_state_uncovered`) and logged — service DB/app content, a created user's home dir + password hash until the next rebuild, backups already pushed to a provider, DNS records created at a provider, and a disabled service's torn-down unit when no Tor mutation channel was available. No silent caps.
109. Per-deploy local state (keepass secret DBs, L3 golden baselines) is git-ignored; the raw `userdata.json` is used only in-memory for restore and is never recorded or persisted.

## Integrity — hidden build inputs (Track 2, item 2, req 91)
110. The clean-state check also catches build-affecting files that `git status` cannot see: a catalog `guard_paths` file (e.g. users.nix, .env, .envrc, flake.local.nix, local.nix, secrets.nix) that is gitignored AND present in a repo under test is recorded (`guard_files`, with a content sha) and warned. A tracked guard file is already in the committed state, and an untracked one already trips the dirty gate — so only the gitignored+present (truly invisible) case is surfaced.
111. A self-contained nixosTest VM build must be hermetic: if the host nix `sandbox` is not `true`, or the build command passes `--impure`, the run is refused (recorded `hermetic`/`hermetic_problems`, with `nix_sandbox`/`impure`). Bypass only with `--allow-dirty` (then recorded as forced). This catches host state leaking into a build that is supposed to reflect only the committed code.

## Integrity — full build-closure identity (Track 2, item 3, req 92)
112. The recorded state identity is the exact build closure, not only the three input pins (api/nixpkgs/manager). A self-contained test (L1/L2) records its derivation path (`drv`/`closure`, via `nix eval <attr>.drvPath` — which captures every transitive input); a box run records the box's running-system store path (`closure`). A short hash of the closure is folded into `state_id` so two builds that differ only in a transitive input cannot collide on one identity.
113. The matrix surfaces the closure per run (in the run-history drawer) and flags closure divergence: more than one distinct build closure across runs on the same code-state key means a transitive input changed (same commits, different actual build). The sidebar grouping stays by repo-commits so a code state still shows all its tests together.

## Harness UX — fail fast before I/O
114. Args-only preconditions are rejected before any git fetch / lock read / SSH: a no-op entry (@todo/@manual) or an L3 run whose args can't work (no --on; a box setup missing --ip/--key/--token; chutney on a box; an android client not yet supported) fails in milliseconds, instead of paying per-entry base-building (notably `repos_behind_upstream(fetch=True)`'s `git fetch`). The authoritative box checks (reachability, live onion/domain, stamp identity) still run for valid args.

## Reproducibility — retargeting the rig to new hardware
115. Pointing the netboot + deploy rig at a different target device is a single scripted, explicit-args operation — not a hand-edit and not an AI task. `dev-dashboard/tools/retarget_device.sh` discovers the new target's NIC MAC and disks from the running netboot installer over SSH, then rewrites the two hardware-specific files (the `dnsmasq.conf` MAC→pinned-IP reservation and the `disko.nix` disk layout, by stable by-id), with backups, a confirm before wiping, and single- or dual-disk support.

## Integrity — install-method must match the claimed column
116. The deployment stamp records the install method, and a test that runs against a box verifies it: a result only lands in an install-method column (usb vs lan/netboot vs vm) if the box was actually installed that way — matched by family, since the fine `a/b/c/d` variants share one install. Otherwise the run is refused (bypass `--allow-dirty`, recorded as a method mismatch), so e.g. a `usb-*` cell can't go green against a lan-installed box.

## Install UX — verify the right target device
117. The harness helps you install to the RIGHT physical device, not just the right code. `dash find-target` discovers candidates — the netboot DHCP leases first (a device that booted into the installer), then a scan of every connected LAN incl. the direct-cable netboot subnet — shows each MAC+IP, and asks you to confirm the one matching the MAC shown on the target's own screen before printing the install command. The install itself stays MAC-locked (it finds/adopts the box only by the MAC you pass), so it can never silently talk to a different machine.

## Install UX — adapt to the target hardware
118. Installing to a DIFFERENT physical device adapts automatically: before writing anything, the install checks whether the deploy flake's disks (by stable id) exist on the target and, on a mismatch, retargets the disk layout (+ netboot MAC pin) from the target's real hardware — asking ONCE, up front, which disk to WIPE. A disko pinned to one machine's serials isn't portable; the install adapts instead of failing with a cryptic disko error.
119. The fine install setups are runnable ids: `install.lan-setup-0a..0d` / `install.usb-0a..0c` resolve to the coarse installer while recording the fine setup as the method. A setup that leaves the target on wifi (…-0b/0c/0d) requires a wifi spec (`--env WIFI_SSID=…`), verified in range by a non-disruptive scan (reqs 72–73) before anything is written.

## End-to-end flow (install a box → test it) + where secrets live
*(Visualised in the README: `docs/deployer.svg` = what the installer is made of + what you provide;
`docs/flow.svg` = the 3 steps below.)*

120. The whole flow is three steps; each prints what you feed the next:
   - **0. Get ready** — cable the device to this laptop, boot it in UEFI network mode (it shows its MAC),
     then start the address server: `sudo bash ~/netboot/start-netboot-server.sh` (leave it running).
   - **1. Find the device** — `./dash find-target` → prints the target's MAC + IP, e.g.
     `MAC 80:e8:2c:15:81:8b   IP 192.168.100.29`.
   - **2. Install** — paste the MAC + IP from step 1:
     ```
     ./dash run install.lan-setup-0d \
       --ip <IP-from-step-1> --key ~/.ssh/<your-key> \
       --env FLAKE=<path to selfprivacy-altnet-deployer> \
       --env MAC=<MAC-from-step-1> --env DOMAIN=<your-web-address e.g. selfprivacy.example.com> \
       --env WIFI_SSID=<your-wifi-name> --env WIFI_PSK=<your-wifi-password> \
       --env NETBOOT=auto --env TRANSPORT=none
     ```
     → it confirms which disk to WIPE `[y/N]`, installs, and prints `done` (auto-adapts disks + MAC to
     this device; see reqs 116/118).
   - **3. Test the running box** —
     ```
     ./dash run L3.connect.desktop --net https --on lan-setup-0d \
       --ip <box-IP> --key ~/.ssh/<your-key> --token <box-api-token>
     ```
     → `pass` (green) = it works; `fail` (red) → the log says why.
121. **Where sensitive data lives:** the wifi password, the box's API token, the TLS certificate and ssh
   keys are written only into the deployer's `state/` folder on this computer. `state/` is git-ignored and
   excluded from the mirror (`rsync --exclude state`), so it is never pushed/uploaded. To version it
   safely too, lock the whole folder with ONE passphrase — `age -p` over a tar of `state/` → one
   encrypted `state.age` (symmetric = post-quantum-adequate) that can go in a private repo.

## Install UX — fill in the flake automatically
122. After `dash find-target` confirms a target, it resolves the last two blanks of the install command for you (via `tools/resolve_flake.sh`): the deploy FLAKE is auto-found (the sibling folder whose `flake.nix` declares `nixosConfigurations.box` — i.e. `selfprivacy-altnet-deployer`; a list to pick from, or a prompt, if there are zero or several), and the DOMAIN is suggested from that flake. It then asks which network setup to use (lan-setup-0a/0b/0c/0d — how the box gets online after install), prompting for the wifi SSID + password (entered hidden) only when the chosen setup needs wifi, and prints the fully-filled command (wifi password masked) and offers to run it.

## Install UX — the flow ends with the next steps spelled out
123. When an install finishes, the installer prints a **NEXT STEPS** block so the operator never has to
   reconstruct them: (a) the exact **L3 integration-test command** that drives the app against this
   backend (`./dash run L3.connect.desktop --net … --on <the setup just installed> --ip … --key … --token …`,
   with the box's real API token filled in — read from `secrets.json`); (b) the **5 DNS A-records** to add
   (`api`/`cloud`/`git`/`matrix`/`meet`.<domain>) pointing at the box's LAN IP (home access) or the
   router's public IP (public access + forward :443); (c) a **concise on-box command**
   (`ping -c1 1.1.1.1 && hostname -I`) to find the box's IP + confirm internet, for when the host can't
   see it (e.g. a wifi setup — after power-cycle the box is on a different radio/MAC/network). On the live
   path (box already online) the DNS records and L3 command are printed with the real IP already filled in.
   The suggested `--on` reflects the fine setup actually installed (`dash` passes `SP_SETUP`).

## Guided post-install finish (reboot → online → DNS → verify)
124. After an install, the operator can be walked through the whole finish **interactively**
   (`tools/finish_box_setup.sh`, offered automatically at the end of an interactive install and
   runnable standalone later): (1) prompt to **reboot** the box (wifi-only: unplug the install cable);
   (2) **wait** until it is reachable over SSH again (by `--ip`, or found by `--mac`, or typed in from
   the console's `hostname -I`); (3) **confirm it booted the installed system** (secrets.json present,
   not the in-RAM installer); (4) **verify internet**; (5) **read the box's public IP** (and LAN IP);
   (6) print the **5 DNS A-records with that IP already filled in**; (7) ask **"did you enter them?"** and,
   on yes, **verify they actually resolve** to that IP — querying PUBLIC resolvers (1.1.1.1 / 8.8.8.8) so
   the laptop's cache or `/etc/hosts` can't mask the result. Each record is classified: ✓ matches the
   public IP, ⚠ resolves to the box's LAN/private IP (home-only, not reachable from outside), ✗ wrong IP
   or not propagated yet; a re-check loop handles propagation delay. On success it prints the ready L3
   integration-test command. All CLI args explicit; `--domain`/`--key` required. Fully non-interactive
   installs (CI/pipes) are unchanged — the guided finish is only offered when a terminal is present.
   **Placement preserves timing integrity:** under `dash` the install runs in a captured pipe, so `dash`
   launches the guided finish on the real terminal only AFTER the install record is written — the human's
   time inside it (incl. DNS-propagation waits) never counts toward the install's recorded `duration_s`,
   so a clean install is never mis-marked `slow`. A standalone run of the installer (`stdout` is a tty)
   offers it inline instead. The two paths are mutually exclusive (keyed on whether stdout is a terminal).

## HTTPS tunnels (public reachability without router access)
125. A box behind double-NAT or a third-party gateway (no inbound port-forward possible) can still be
   reached from the public internet by an **outbound tunnel the box dials itself** — nothing is forwarded
   IN. `tools/add-cloudflare.sh` wires this up over SSH, offered interactively at the end of an install
   (`e2e_install_native_ethernet.sh`) or run standalone later.
126. It asks **three things, with no silent defaults**: (1) *Do you already have a paid domain?* → it
   prints the exact DNS records to set; (2) *Do you want a free domain?* → a Cloudflare **quick** tunnel
   needs none (random `*.trycloudflare.com`), or register a free **custom** domain at `https://nic.eu.org`
   and pass it in; (3) *transport* = `cloudflare` (free), `ngrok` (free tier = random `*.ngrok-free.app`),
   or `router` (free but needs admin on every NAT hop).
127. **Cloudflare** transport: with no domain → an account-less **quick tunnel** fronting the
   `api.<box-domain>` vhost only (URL is temporary, changes on restart); with a `--domain` → a
   **headless named tunnel** — you create the tunnel in the Cloudflare dashboard on your laptop and paste
   its **connector token** (`--cf-tunnel-token`); the box only runs `cloudflared tunnel run --token …`,
   installed + started over SSH. The 5 public hostnames (api/cloud/git/matrix/meet) are added once in the
   dashboard (each auto-creates its DNS CNAME). **Nothing is ever typed on the box** — no on-box
   `cloudflared tunnel login`.
128. **ngrok** transport: installs ngrok on the box (unfree → `--impure`), takes the free authtoken, runs
   `ngrok http https://localhost:443` with the box's Host header; a custom domain is a paid ngrok feature
   (called out explicitly).
129. **router** transport: not automatable for arbitrary routers — it prints the port-forward
   (`TCP 443 → <box-lan>:443`) + the 5 A-records at the public IP, and defers DNS verification to
   `finish_box_setup.sh`.
130. Whatever the transport, the tunnel runs as a **persistent systemd unit** on the box (cloudflared/ngrok
   installed into root's nix profile = gc-rooted, survives reboot), and the script ends by printing the
   app `--dart-define=HTTPS_DOMAIN=…` command and the `./dash run L3.connect.desktop --net https` line with
   the box's real API token filled in.
131. All CLI args explicit; `--key`/`--ip` required; a non-interactive run must pass every choice
   (`--method`, `--domain-kind`, …) or fail fast — the same command reproduces the same setup for anyone.
   Preflight refuses to run unless the box is reachable **and** is the installed system (`secrets.json`
   present), not the in-RAM installer.
132. The public-access choice is made **up-front**, at the "your web address" prompt in
   `resolve_flake.sh` (right after the device is connected) — because the chosen method **decides the
   domain**, and the domain is baked into the box at deploy time (vhost routing + LE cert); asking it at
   the end would be too late. `add-cloudflare.sh --plan` asks the three questions with **no box needed**
   and hands back `DOMAIN` + method (`PUBLIC_METHOD` / `PUBLIC_DOMAIN_KIND` / `PUBLIC_CF_NAMED`) as
   `KEY=VALUE` on stdout; those flow via `--env` into the install and drive the end-of-install apply, so
   the domain is never asked twice and a Cloudflare **custom** domain is consistent end-to-end. A quick
   tunnel / free-ngrok / none keep the flake's **default** domain baked in — their public URL is decided
   post-install (random `*.trycloudflare.com` / `*.ngrok-free.app`).
133. The public-access apply is **embedded** and runs **entirely over SSH** — the operator never opens a
   shell on the box. When a method was chosen up-front, `finish_box_setup.sh` (which already rebooted the
   box, brought it online and discovered its IP) runs `add-cloudflare.sh` as its final **step 8** with
   that IP; `dash` and `e2e_install_native_ethernet.sh` forward `--public-method` / `--public-cf-named`
   to it. So `dash find-target` → install → finish → tunnel is one unbroken flow with **zero manual box
   interaction**; the only human step for a named tunnel is pasting a Cloudflare token on the laptop.
134. **Pinggy** transport (`--method pinggy`): an **SSH-based** tunnel the box dials out over `ssh -p 443
   -R0:localhost:443 … a.pinggy.io` — **nothing to install** (ssh is already on the box), run as a
   persistent systemd unit. Free tier = random `*.pinggy.link` with ~60-min sessions; a `--pinggy-token`
   (pinggy.io account) makes it persistent + custom. Caveat logged: SelfPrivacy vhosts are Host-routed on
   :443, so a Host-header rewrite may be needed for the api vhost.
135. **LocalTunnel** transport (`--method localtunnel`): installs `nodePackages.localtunnel` (`lt`) into
   the box's nix profile and runs `lt --port 443 --local-https --allow-invalid-cert --host
   https://localtunnel.me [--subdomain <prefix>]` as a systemd unit → `https://<prefix>.loca.lt`. Caveats
   logged: loca.lt shows a one-time browser interstitial (API/app clients send `Bypass-Tunnel-Reminder:
   true`), and it fronts ONE endpoint (Host-routed cloud/git/… need separate tunnels).
136. **Free-domain source** is a menu (`--domain-source`): **`eu-org`** (nic.eu.org — a real DELEGABLE
   domain whose NS point to Cloudflare; works with a Cloudflare tunnel AND the router method, but SLOW
   manual approval), **`duckdns`** / **`afraid`** (instant, but A/TXT only — **router method only**, they
   can't host a Cloudflare tunnel's CNAME/NS), or **`other`**. The menu states these limits honestly and
   steers tunnel users to `eu-org`. DuckDNS, when chosen for the router method, prints its dynamic-DNS
   updater line (it maps a name to YOUR public IP — still needs :443 forwarded).
137. **Direct IPv6** transport (`--method ipv6`): the only route that is reliable + no-port-forward AND
   **decentralised** (no relay) — because IPv6 has no NAT to traverse. It reads the box's global IPv6
   (`2000::/3`), fails fast with a clear message if the ISP is IPv4-only/CGNAT, and publishes an **AAAA**
   record for the chosen domain — for a `*.duckdns.org` domain with `--duckdns-token` it installs a
   persistent on-box updater (`duckdns-aaaa-sp`) that keeps the AAAA on the box's current IPv6 across
   reboots/prefix-changes; otherwise it prints the AAAA to set. The box's own Let's Encrypt provisions
   the cert. Caveat logged: visitors must also have IPv6. The route map lives in `docs/tunneling.puml`
   (rendered `docs/tunneling.svg`, referenced from `networks.md` → Tunneling) with the A–E scoring.
138. **Public vs private IP must ALWAYS be explicit** — in every operator-facing message AND in the
   code/comments. Any IP (or a command that yields one) is labelled either **LAN / private** (to connect
   to the box over the local network — `hostname -I` → 192.168.x.x) or **public** (reachable from
   anywhere, for DNS records / port-forward — `curl -s https://api.ipify.org` for IPv4, or
   `ip -6 addr show scope global` for the public IPv6). Never ask for or print "the IP" unqualified.
   Concretely: `finish_box_setup.sh` steps 1–2 ask for the box's **LAN IP** (only to SSH in) and read the
   **public** IP themselves at step 5; DNS-record prompts state LAN (home-only) vs public (from-anywhere);
   every `--ip` flag is the box's LAN/SSH address, never a public one.
139. **Tailscale Funnel** transport (`--method tailscale`): the recommended FREE way to reach the box
   from any IPv4 visitor behind an uncontrolled router (CGNAT/double-NAT) without IPv6 or port-forward.
   Installs tailscale on the box, runs `tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking` (no kernel TUN) as a
   systemd unit, joins the tailnet with a one-time **auth key** (generated in the admin console — nothing
   typed on the box), and `tailscale funnel https+insecure://localhost:443` → a **stable**
   `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net` with a valid cert. One-time admin-console prerequisites (HTTPS certs
   + the `funnel` node attribute) are printed if Funnel isn't live. It's ONE hostname → the app connects
   at the apex (`HTTPS_APEX`); the full api./cloud./… suite still needs a real domain + CF tunnel/forward.
140. **IPv6 autodetect runs on the box's FINAL network, not the install path.** IPv6 is a property of the
   network the box ends up on — which for `lan-setup-0c/0d` / usb variants can be a different wifi/router
   than the install cable or the laptop — so a pre-install check is meaningless. `tools/net_lib.sh`
   `box_global_ipv6` probes the box (post-reboot, in `finish_box_setup` step 4b) for a global-unicast
   (`2000::/3`) address with working v6 egress on ANY interface, and says to re-run if the box later moves.
141. **The box's domain is an install PARAMETER, never a hardcoded personal domain.** The deploy flake
   reads `./domain.local` (tracked, generic default `selfprivacy.box`); the installer dirty-overwrites it
   per deploy and restores the generic default afterwards, so a real/personal domain only ever enters as a
   chosen value and never lands in the committed codebase. Cert source (`cert-source.local`) defaults to
   `selfsigned` (any domain / tunnel), `external-le` when a real LE cert for the domain is injected.

## Robust prompts & tunnel apply (hardened 2026-10-09)
142. **Every interactive question validates its answer and re-asks until it's valid — it NEVER quits or
   silently defaults on a bad answer.** A single typo must never drop the whole flow (losing all prior
   answers). Only an explicit `n`/blank cancels where cancelling is meaningful; no-TTY / non-interactive
   runs fail fast naming the exact flag to pass, instead of looping forever. Enforced across: the
   `dash find-target` target pick + confirm; `resolve_flake.sh` (flake / network-setup / wifi SSID+PSK /
   run-now); `add-cloudflare.sh` `run_wizard` AND the flag-fallback (`need()` re-asks until non-empty;
   `ask_choice` re-asks fixed choices; domains validated via `is_domain`); `finish_box_setup.sh` (box LAN
   IP validates four octets 0-255; the "added the records?"/"re-check?" gates via a `yesno` helper); the
   `dash` "Finish setup now? [Y/n]" gate (an IP typed there re-asks with a hint, is not read as "no");
   `make_keepass_db.sh` master-password (re-ask until non-empty + matching); `e2e_install_usb.sh`
   device-path confirm (mismatch re-asks; blank aborts — it's a destructive erase, exact match required).
143. **The Tailscale auth-key step is self-explanatory and self-verifying.** The prompt prints
   step-by-step instructions (open the admin console, sign up if needed, Generate auth key, copy, paste),
   rejects anything not starting `tskey-`, and VERIFIES the key the only way possible — by joining and
   checking the box reaches `Running` — re-asking in place on failure. Keys are SINGLE-USE: a fresh key
   is needed for every setup (tick **Reusable** for several boxes). A rejected key is distinguished from a
   connectivity problem using the real `tailscale up` output, pointing at `journalctl -u tailscaled-sp`.
144. **When a step can't be reliably automated, the script captures the EXACT action and walks the
   operator through it — it never fails vaguely.** Enabling Tailscale Funnel is a one-time, browser-only,
   tailnet-owner consent: the script captures the exact pre-filled `https://login.tailscale.com/f/funnel?
   node=…` URL that `tailscale funnel` prints, shows click-by-click steps, waits, and retries until Funnel
   actually serves. Blocking remote commands (`funnel --bg`, `up`) are `timeout`-capped so a prompt can
   never hang the flow.
145. **On-box services are installed the NixOS-correct way.** `/etc/systemd/system` is a read-only
   Nix-store symlink, so imperative tunnel units are written to the writable `/run/systemd/system` and
   `systemctl start`-ed (not `enable`-d). Caveat logged: `/run` is cleared on reboot, so re-run the apply
   after a box reboot; true reboot-persistence would bake the unit into the deploy flake.
146. **Re-running an apply is idempotent and non-destructive.** The Tailscale apply authenticates only
   when the box isn't already on the tailnet — it polls `BackendState` after the (re)started daemon
   reconnects (absorbing the race), never passes `--reset`, so it never logs the box out or spawns
   duplicate nodes (`selfprivacy-1`, `-2`, …). `tailscale status --json` is parsed whitespace-tolerantly
   (`"Key": "val"` has a space after the colon — a naive `":"` matcher silently never matches).
147. **Every operator-facing command states WHICH DEVICE to run it on and is copy-paste-runnable.**
   Commands that SSH into the box say "on THIS laptop" (never on the box); the printed Flutter command
   includes `cd <…/selfprivacy.org.app> &&` so it runs from the app's own project root (where
   `pubspec.yaml` is), not from `dev-dashboard`.
148. **Single-hostname tunnels expose the API/app endpoint ONLY — set that expectation explicitly.**
   tailscale / cloudflare-quick / ngrok-free / pinggy / localtunnel each give ONE public hostname.
   Opening it in a browser shows the box's default nginx page at `/` and GraphiQL at `/graphql` — there
   is NO web login page; the server is managed from the SelfPrivacy app (point it at the host with
   `HTTPS_APEX=1`). The browser login frontends (`api.<domain>` → `/user`, Nextcloud `cloud.`, Forgejo
   `git.`, …) are name-based nginx vhosts; a single hostname reaches the API vhost only if the Host header
   matches `api.<domain>`, and **Tailscale Funnel cannot rewrite the Host header** (unlike ngrok /
   cf-quick `--host-header`), so over Funnel only `/graphql` (which the default server also serves) is
   reached and the app works while the browser frontends do not. Full browser / 5-subdomain access needs
   a real domain + a Cloudflare NAMED tunnel (or router port-forward / direct IPv6). **Open TODO:** make
   the SelfPrivacy API nginx the `default_server` on the box so the funnel host reaches the API vhost in a
   browser too (deployer-module change + box rebuild).

## North-star objective & reachability wait
149. **NORTH STAR: the whole `find-target` → install → finish → public-access flow must work end-to-end
   for a NON-TECHNICAL user ("grandma") on a random laptop and random home network, with ZERO manual
   device fixing.** This is the point of the project — not getting one SelfPrivacy box up, but perfecting
   the SCRIPTS so anyone can. Every rough edge hit while testing is a bug to fix **in the script** (wizard
   / deployer / apply), never a one-off patch typed on the box by hand. The operator — human OR AI — must
   not SSH into the box to make it work; if something only works after hand-fixing the device, the script
   is not done. Success = the user runs the printed commands only, answers plain-language questions, waits,
   and ends with a working public URL + the app connecting — understanding none of the internals. A
   developer re-installing repeatedly is a tester, not the target user; artifacts that only appear from
   repeated re-installs (e.g. duplicate tunnel identities) must be handled by the script, not blamed on
   the user.
150. **The apply WAITS until the box is actually reachable from the public internet, with visible
   progress — it never stops at "serving on the box".** Serving locally ≠ publicly reachable: tunnel
   providers (Tailscale Funnel, Cloudflare, …) publish public DNS for a NEW name minutes after it is
   enabled. `add-cloudflare.sh` `wait_reachable()` polls the public URL FROM THE LAPTOP (which uses public
   DNS, unlike the box's MagicDNS) until it responds — printing progress — up to a generous ceiling
   (`SP_REACH_TIMEOUT`, default 600s), and only THEN presents the app command. Each attempt is shown as a
   numbered check with elapsed time and a PLAIN reason derived from curl's exit code (6 = "address not
   published yet (DNS)", 7 = "not accepting connections", 28 = "timed out", 35/60 = "TLS/cert warming up",
   22 = "HTTP error") so the user sees it is actively doing something. Polling uses a GENTLE backoff
   (10→30s) — ~20 checks over 10 min, not 40 — to avoid hammering DNS / the tunnel provider and tripping
   rate limits. On timeout it explains in plain language and names the single likely cause (leftover
   duplicate nodes from repeated re-installs — a testing artifact, not something a one-time setup hits).
   The non-technical user just waits; they never debug DNS, delete nodes, or re-run by hand. (Applies to
   every single-hostname tunnel method, not only tailscale.)
